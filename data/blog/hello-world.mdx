This blog is my working log — a place to think out loud, track bugs I never want to debug again, and document the tools I’m building. Some are for me. Some might be useful to others. Either way, I’m here to write it down.

You’ll find notes on backend architecture, edge cases, design tradeoffs, and half-formed ideas about systems, simplicity, and software. I’ll also share updates on whatever I’m building — personal tools, experiments, or side projects in progress.

But it’s not all code. I’m also carving out space for the rest of my life:

- **Day trips** — everywhere is a day trip from somewhere
- **Camping logs** — what worked, what didn’t, what to bring next time and what to leave at home
- **Gardening experiments** — seasonal notes and progress tracking
- **Home improvement projects** — lessons learned (sometimes the hard way)
- **Recipes and food reviews** — what I’ve cooked, what I’d change, and where I’ve eaten
- **Books, shows, and movies** — notes and reviews from whatever I’m reading or watching
- **Loose thoughts** on life, tech, and trying to do both with intention

This site isn’t built for reach or polish. It’s here so I can look back and see what I was thinking — and maybe find what I’d forgotten.

It’s mostly a record for me — the bugs fixed, tools built, and lessons learned. If it’s useful to you too, I’m glad it found you.
