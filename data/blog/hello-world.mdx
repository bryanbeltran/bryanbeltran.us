This blog is a workspace — a place to think out loud, document edge cases I never want to debug twice, and share the tools I’m building (often for myself, sometimes for others).

You’ll find notes on backend architecture, obscure bugs, performance hacks, design decisions I want to remember, and half-finished thoughts on systems, simplicity, and software.

But it’s not all code. I’m also carving out space here for other things I care about:

- **Day trips** (I believe everywhere is a day trip from somewhere)
- **Camping logs** and practical outdoors notes
- **Gardening experiments** and seasonal progress
- **Project updates** from my personal software builds
- Occasional commentary on life, tech, and trying to do both well

This isn’t meant to go viral, optimize for reach, or pretend to be more polished than it is. Just a steady trail of entries I can look back on.

Thanks for stopping by — or not. I’m mostly writing this for future me anyway.
