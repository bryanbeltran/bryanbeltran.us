I’m a backend software developer with 6+ years of experience building internal systems that support large-scale customer care operations.

I started my career on the e-commerce team at [QBP](https://www.qbp.com), then joined the IAM team at [Calabrio](https://www.calabrio.com), and now I build backend tools on the Agent Experience team at Chewy. My work helps thousands of agents across chat, phone, and pharmacy channels serve customers more efficiently.

I enjoy building systems that sit at the intersection of empathy and engineering — tools that reduce friction, streamline decision-making, and improve the experience on both sides of the support interaction.

Outside of work, I focus on solving real-world problems through small, satisfying tools — like a frost-aware garden planner, a SPED classroom behavior logger, and the [Mitten Index](https://github.com/bryanbeltran/mitten-index), a tongue-in-cheek but functional tool to help you decide whether to bundle up (or hit the grocery store before the next snowstorm).

I like tools that are useful, personal, and thoughtfully built — and I’m always pushing to grow as an engineer and expand what I can build.
