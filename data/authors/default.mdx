I'm a backend developer with 7+ years of experience building tools that solve real problems—for myself, my community, and my wife’s classroom. I enjoy working on projects that combine practicality with creativity, from simulating traffic flow to planning cold-climate gardens.

Right now I'm focused on building tools for educators, experimenting with cold weather scoring models, and moving side projects into production.
