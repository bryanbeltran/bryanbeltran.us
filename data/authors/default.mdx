I'm a backend developer with 7+ years of experience building systems that support customer service teams. I started my career on the e-commerce team at [QBP](https://www.qbp.com), then joined the IAM team at [Calabrio](https://www.calabrio.com), and now I build internal tools on the Agent Experience team at Chewy — helping customer service agents deliver the kind of support Chewy is known for.

Outside of work, I'm focused on building tools for myself, experimenting with cold weather scoring models, and shipping side projects that solve real problems in small, satisfying ways.

I like projects that are practical and personally useful — from making it easier to plan my garden to building the [Mitten Index](https://github.com/bryanbeltran/mitten-index), a tongue-in-cheek but useful tool that helps you decide how to dress (or whether to make a grocery run before tomorrow's snowstorm).
